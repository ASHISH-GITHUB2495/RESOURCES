/*
when N <= 10, then both O(N!) and O(2N) are ok (for 2N probably N <= 20 is ok too)
when N <= 100, then O(N3) is ok (I guess that N4 is also ok, but never tried)
when N <= 1.000, then N2 is also ok
when N <= 1.000.000, then O(N) is fine (I guess that 10.000.000 is fine too, but I never tried in contest)
finally when N = 1.000.000.000 then O(N) is NOT ok, you have to find something better…*/
